# Math 4345: Formal Proof

## Course overview

This course provides an introduction to formal proof in
mathematics. It is designed for math majors who seek a comprehensive
understanding of how to use proof assistants and how to encode a
mathematical proof in such a way that one can formally verify its
correctness.

## Credits 

I am very thankful for conversations with

- [Philip Wood](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~pmwood/) about his experience creating [Math 161](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~pmwood/Teaching/2023sMath161/) at Harvard
- [Heather Macbeth](https://faculty.fordham.edu/hmacbeth1/) and her [Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/) textbook.

I also used [Mathematics in Lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean) as
a reference in creating the course.
